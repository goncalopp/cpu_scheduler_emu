To test, please run the interactive command **run.py**

This program simulates and compares the performance of various CPU scheduling algorithms, including RoundRobin scheduler, O(1) scheduler and stride scheduling.

It does this by emulating, in pure python, multiple components of a virtual machine, including:

 - Hardware
   - CPU (multiple opcodes, context switching)
   - RAM
   - A hardware timer
   - A I/O device ("hard disk")
   - A PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller)

 - A primitive "Operating System"
   - Relocating Program Loader
   - I/O and timer drivers
   - Process Manager (Process Control Blocks, dispatcher)
   - Multiple CPU scheduling algorithms

It also includes some sample programs in  "assembly" (Fibonacci, sum of natural numbers), a tool to generate ("assembly") programs with varying I/O behaviour and tools for automatically loading various multiprocess scenarios and analysing and graphing the process progress and resulting performance (using python-gnuplot).
